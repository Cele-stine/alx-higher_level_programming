2.The aphabet game
THis is a python script that prints lowercase alphabets.

Using the same approuch as in code 2 i print lowercase letters but this time ommiting the letters e and q.
For this i had to add in an if statment that ensures that the letters i dont want to print are not present then prints the rest off the letters
