This is a test file for a function that divides all elements in a matrix.

==================================
HOW TO USE 2-matrix_divided.txt
==================================

Usage:
======

"matrix_divided()" takes two parameters that is the matrix(matrix) and
a constant divisor(div).
"matrix_divided()" returns a new matrix of rhe result from the division.

::

    >>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided
    >>> matrix = [
    ...    [3, 6, 9],
    ...    [12, 15, 18]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    [[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]]


::

Note that the result is being rounded off to the nearest two decimal places.

::

    >>> matrix = [
    ...    [2, 3, 4],
    ...    [5, 6, 7]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    [[0.67, 1.0, 1.33], [1.67, 2.0, 2.33]]

::

Matrix can be of floats.

::

    >>> matrix = [
    ...    [2.0, 3.2, 4.5],
    ...    [5.4, 2.8, 3.0]
    ... ]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    [[0.67, 1.07, 1.5], [1.8, 0.93, 1.0]]

Division cannot be done with a zero.

::

    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 0))
    Traceback (most recent last call):
    ZeroDivisonError: division by zero
