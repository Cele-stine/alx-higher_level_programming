   DOCTEST
Doctest is a built-in test FRAMEWORK that comes bundled with Python by default.

Testing is the process of evaluating a system or its component(s) with the intent to find whether it satisfies the specified requirements or not. Testing is executing a system in order to identify any gaps, errors, or missing requirements contrary to the actual requirements.

Code that is not tested canâ€™t be trusted.
